then create an admin page that can be accessible if username is *gleritas_admin_login_only*

admin page should have the following navigations:
Home - where overview of how many registered users, how many completed tasks, how many GLRS points have been claimed by users, how many active users, how many users has connected their wallets
Tasks - where admin can add or edit tasks which will show on users task tab once done
