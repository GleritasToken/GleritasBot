Change award system from GLRS Token to GLRS Points

GLRS network chain is on the BSC with the contract link https://bscscan.com/address/0x7c427B65ebA206026A055B04c6086AC9af40B1B4, try and implement this everywhere needed in the app

Also, whenever users click on connect wallet, their pre installed crypto app on phone should open and attempt to connect their BSC wallet to the app 

Here is a clean list of 3 creative and fair options users can pick from to complete the fee requirement inside the bot without feeling forced:

Option 1: Boost Your Earnings
Label in App: Boost Your Airdrop Points
Description: Get x2 Airdrop Rewards when you upgrade your account with a one-time boost fee of $3 (in BNB). This unlocks double earnings, early withdrawal access, and exclusive referral bonuses.

This makes them earn double for each tasks done. Example: They earn 50 GLRS points instead of 25

Option 2: Complete Premium Task
Label in App: Unlock Premium Task Access
Description: Users gets access to exclusive GLRS tasks with higher rewards and instant eligibility for whitelist/referral bonuses. Requires one-time access payment of $3 (in BNB).

Option 3: Priority Withdrawal Slot
Label in Bot: Reserve Your Withdrawal Slot
Description: Secure a guaranteed spot in the early withdrawal batch by confirming your slot now with a $3 (BNB) confirmation fee.

All the options will be clickable under the withdrawal section which will redirect them to sign a smart contract under their crypto app whether it's an android device or it's an iOS device, it opens their wallet that's already installed on their phones and proceeds for them to approve the transaction 

The 1$ withdraw fees should also be remmited to GLRS wallet but currently, withdraw should be locked and the button should be labeled *withdrawal available soon*

Fees which will be remitted automatically to 0x7c427B65ebA206026A055B04c6086AC9af40B1B4

If there's anything you need from me to complete this and make it work perfectly kindly let me know
